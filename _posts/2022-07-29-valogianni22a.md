title: 'Causal ABMs: Learning Plausible Causal Models using Agent-based Modeling '
abstract: We present Causal ABM, a methodology to derive causal structures describing
  complex underlying behavioral phenomena. Agent-based models (ABMs) have powerful
  advantages for causal modeling that have not been explored sufficiently. Unlike
  traditional causal estimation approaches which often result in “one best” causal
  structure that is learned, two properties of ABMs - equifinality (the ability of
  different sets of conditions or model representations to yield the same outcome)
  and mutlifinality (the same ABM might yield different outcomes) - can be exploited
  to learn multiple diverse “plausible causal models” from data. Using an illustrative
  example of news sharing on social networks we show how this idea can be applied
  to learn such causal sets. We also show how genetic algorithms can be used as a
  estimation technique to learn multiple plausible causal models from data due to
  their parallel search structure. However, significant computational challenges remain
  before this can be generally applied, and we, therefore, highlight specific key
  issues that need to be addressed in future work.
