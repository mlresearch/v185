title: GPU Acceleration for Information-theoretic Constraint-based Causal Discovery
abstract: The discovery of causal relationships from observational data is an omnipresent
  task in data science. In real-world scenarios, observational data is often high-dimensional,
  and functional causal relationships can be nonlinear. To handle nonlinear relationships
  within constraint-based causal discovery, appropriate conditional independence tests
  (CI-tests) become necessary, e.g., non-parametric information-theory-based CI-tests.
  Both high- dimensional data and CI-tests for nonlinear relationships pose computational
  challenges. Existing work proposes parallel processing on Graphics Processing Units
  (GPUs) to address the computational demand resulting from high-dimensional data,
  in the case of discrete data or linear relationships. We extend this idea to cover
  CI-tests for nonlinear relationships in our work. Therefore, we develop GPUCMIknn,
  a GPU-accelerated version of an existing CI-test, which builds upon conditional
  mutual information (CMI) combined with a local permutation scheme. Further, we propose
  a version of the PC algorithm, called GPUCMIknn-Parallel, to process multiple instances
  of GPUCMIknn on the GPU in parallel. Experiments show that the performance of GPUCMIknn
  is mainly affected by the number of k-nearest-neighbors (knn) within the CMI estimation.
  Depending on the chosen number of knn, the achieved speedup of GPUCMIknn ranges
  between factors of 2.3 to 352. In causal discovery, our method GPUCMIknn-Parallel
  outperforms a single-threaded CPU version by factors of up to 1 000, a multi-threaded
  CPU version using eight cores by factors of up to 240, and a naive GPU version by
  up to a factor 3.
