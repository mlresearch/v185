title: Regret-based Federated Causal Discovery
abstract: In critical applications, causal models are the prime choice for their trustworthiness
  and explainability. If data is inherently distributed and privacy-sensitive, federated
  learning allows for collaboratively training a joint model. Such approaches for
  federated causal discovery, however, require sending local causal models, revealing
  the local data structure. We propose privacy-preserving federated causal discovery
  by distributed min-max regret optimization. This technique requires clients to only
  send local regret values, instead of model parameters, ensuring the privacy of sensitive
  local data. Initial results show that our approach reliably discovers causal networks
  without ever looking at local data or local causal structures.
